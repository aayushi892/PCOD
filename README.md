# üå∏ Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Prediction Using Machine Learning

## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the **PCOS Prediction** project! This innovative application leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes, to predict the likelihood of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome in individuals. With a user-friendly Python interface deployed on **Streamlit**, this tool aims to empower users with quick and accurate health insights.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Utilize a comprehensive dataset that includes various health metrics associated with PCOS.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
- **Model Development**: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the models' performances using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Interactive UI**: Develop an intuitive Streamlit application for users to input their data and receive predictions.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle], and it contains features such as:
